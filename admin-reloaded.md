### Welcome to the New Admin Beta and the Start of October Launch Month

Hey Deco users, we have something new for you! Today, we’re excited to introduce the beta version of our revamped admin panel, available now at [https://admin.deco.cx](https://admin.deco.cx/). Let’s get straight into what’s new and what you can expect in the coming weeks.

#### 1. New Navigation and Topbar Menus

Switching teams is now hassle-free. Do it straight from the topbar, no need to return to the home page. Access team members and billing options instantly, and with the new integrated menu, Pages, Sections, and Analytics are just a click away.

#### 2. New Site Home


We’ve made it simpler and more intuitive, focusing on a clean design that puts your site and important info front and center.

#### 3. New Admin Pages
